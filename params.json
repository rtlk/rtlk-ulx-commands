{"name":"RTLK-ULX-Commands","tagline":"A collection of ULX commands created by RTLK","body":"### Welcome to RTLK's ULX Commands.\r\nThis GitHub hosts a group of commands created for the ULX administration system. The current release has the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPointshop (pointshop-ulx-commands):\r\n!givepoints - Give's the target player(s) a number of points.\r\n!takepoints - Takes the specified number of points from the target player(s)\r\n!setpoints - Sets the target player(s) to have the specified number of points.\r\n!giveitem - Gives the targeted player(s) the specified pointshop item (if they do not have it already.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Future Plugins\r\nIn addition to the released plugins above, I am working on (or planning on working on) adding a group of ULX commands for Cinema, Prophunt v2, and Metastrike. They should be released in that order, but I do not know when any of them will be done. Feel free to suggest things to add in the Release thread on the Ulysses Mod forums or in an issue, tagging it request.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install one of the command packs in this repo, just copy the folder (ie. pointshop-ulx-commands) to your addons directory and restart the server!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAll ULX modules in this pack are created by me (@rtlk). You may see them posted by RTLK, Pvt. Grif, Lynx, or Dark Ember, but they are all me (those are just various names I've used in the past and have accounts set up as.)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with any of the addons in this pack? Head over to the Ulysses Mod forums and ask for support in my release thread, or post a issue on the GitHub repository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
