!givepoints - Give's the target player(s) a number of points.
!takepoints - Takes the specified number of points from the target player(s)
!setpoints - Sets the target player(s) to have the specified number of points.
!giveitem - Gives the targeted player(s) the specified pointshop item (if they do not have it already.)

Cinema (cinema-ulx-commands):
!skipvideo (!skip) - Skips the current video.
!seekvideo (!seek) - Seeks to a certain point in the current video.
!resettheater (!reset) - Resets the theater.
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to the released plugins above, I am working on (or planning on working on) adding a group of ULX commands for Cinema (more commands than the base 3 I have already), Prophunt v2, and Metastrike. They should be released in that order, but I do not know when any of them will be done. Feel free to suggest things to add in the Release thread on the Ulysses Mod forums or in an issue, tagging it request.</p>
